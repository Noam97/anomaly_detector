Anomaly Detector for Flights Gear.

Final project for the "Advanced Programming 1" course at Bar-Ilan University, developed in C++.
I built a server-side anomaly detection engine for flight data using design patterns, polymorphism, STL and other C++ libraries, TCP connection, and multithreading.
Additionally, I developed a C# client app based on the MVVM architecture to simulate and visualize anomaly detection in a flight simulator using basic statistical analysis.
